== Description ==
[Tamboo](https://gettamboo.com) brings to WordPress all the secret tools marketers, startups, and online businesses use to turn their website visitors into customers!

With Tamboo, you'll get the secret tools the pros have been using for years — and start seeing what your website visitors are *really* doing.

Once you see how people use your website, you'll go from wondering why 99% of your visitors never turn into customers - to knowing what you need to do to take your site to the next level.

That's because Tamboo's funnels, visitor recordings, and heatmaps are designed to give you the insights you need to maximize conversions and increase your overall revenue.

= Setting Up Tamboo =
The first step to setting up Tamboo is to add a small snippet of JavaScript to your website.  For Tamboo customers using WordPress, this plugin takes care of that.

Once the Tamboo JavaScript is installed, your site will start automatically recording everything your website visitors do.

= Tamboo's Features =
Tamboo **automatically records everything your website visitors do** - and then gives you the tools you need to understand what their actions mean.

== Visitor Recordings ==
Tamboo's visitor recordings let you watch high-definition video recordings of everything your users see and do on your website - *exactly* as they saw it on their desktop, tablet, or mobile device:

* Watch what people do on your website from the moment they enter to the moment they leave — and everything in between.
* Watch videos of entire visits from start to finish or pick and choose which pages you want to see videos of.
* See every action your visitors take — including every click, scroll, mouse move, and keystroke — in real-time.
* Pause, play, rewind, and fast-forward with ease to get to the parts you want to see.

== Heat Maps ==
With Tamboo's heat maps, you'll be able to see the "big picture" of how your users engage with your website:

* See everything and everywhere your visitors click — in one gorgeous visualization.
* Get automatic counts and CTR calculations for every link, button, and form field.
* Find out where people drop off your pages so you know where to focus on retention.
* Know what your visitors really clicked with intelligent click detection.
* Create custom heatmaps based on traffic sources, tags, and even user behaviors.
* Uncover your most effective CTAs — and find out which ones need work.

== Funnels ==
And with Tamboo's funnels, you'll finally be able to bring order to the chaos of conversion optimization.  Funnels model your customer's journey as they navigate your website from landing page to purchase — and show where you're losing them.  Think of them like treasure maps leading you to conversion gold:

* Easily create your own custom funnels with our easy-to-use funnel builder tool.
* Get the insights and the confidence you need to know where to focus your conversion efforts.
* All the conversion scores and metrics you need to find your next big opportunity.
* Uncover the visual roadmap you've been looking for to guide your optimization decisions.
* Watch visitor recordings of what people do at each step inside of your funnel with a single click.
* Discover where you get your best traffic from — and where you don't.
